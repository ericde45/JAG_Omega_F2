# JAG_Omega_F2
A total rebuild of Omega F2 screen in the Atari ST demo 'swedish new year 89-90'

This one was not easy and straightforward. The original code has strange ways of doing things.
But the result is the greatest logo wave demo. 

and it's even better at 60 HZ !

original code : Liesen and Haq
logo by Red
